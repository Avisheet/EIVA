# EIVA – Emotionally Intelligent Virtual Assistant

## Overview

**EIVA (Emotionally Intelligent Virtual Assistant)** is an advanced conversational AI system that integrates **speech recognition, emotion detection, persistent memory, and natural language processing (NLP)** to deliver context-aware and emotionally intelligent responses. Unlike traditional assistants, EIVA maintains long-term conversational memory, enabling personalized and adaptive interactions that evolve over time.

---

## Key Features

* **Speech-to-Text Processing**: Converts spoken input into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models.
* **Emotion Detection**: Analyzes both textual sentiment and vocal cues to identify emotional states with probability distributions.
* **Persistent Memory**: Stores past interactions, including context and detected emotions, for long-term recall.
* **Contextual Memory Retrieval**: Fetches the most relevant past experiences using semantic similarity and emotion matching.
* **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes input along with retrieved memories and emotional context to generate coherent responses.
* **Emotionally Tuned Responses**: Adapts communication style to match the user’s emotional state and conversational history.

---

## System Architecture

The high-level workflow of EIVA can be described as follows:

1. **Speech Input**

   * User provides input through a microphone.
   * Raw audio signal is captured for processing.

2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**

   * ASR engine (e.g., Whisper, DeepSpeech) transcribes speech into text.
   * Output: textual representation of user input.

3. **Emotion Extraction**

   * Text-based sentiment analysis using transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).
   * Audio-based emotion recognition using acoustic features (e.g., pitch, energy, spectral features).
   * Output: emotion probability vector (e.g., `{happy: 0.65, sad: 0.25, neutral: 0.10}`).

4. **Memory Persistence**

   * Stores the following for each conversation turn:

     * Input text
     * Detected emotions
     * Assistant response
     * Timestamps and metadata
   * Maintained in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, PostgreSQL + PGVector).

5. **Memory Retrieval**

   * For each new query:

     * Embedding of the query is generated.
     * Top-K relevant memories are retrieved using semantic similarity.
     * Emotional state alignment is factored into ranking.

6. **Natural Language Processing**

   * Input, relevant memories, and emotion vector are combined.
   * Data is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM) for contextual response generation.

7. **Response Generation**

   * Response is formulated with attention to emotional state and history.
   * Delivered as both text and synthesized speech (using a TTS engine).

## Example Workflow

**User Input (spoken, with sad tone):**

> "I had such a bad day at work."

**Processing Steps:**

* Speech-to-Text → `"I had such a bad day at work"`
* Emotion Detection → `{sadness:62.06%, disappointment: 34.24%, annoyance: 4.77%}`
* Memory Retrieval → Finds earlier conversations about work stress
```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-15T19:32:00Z",
  "user_input": "My manager has been overloading me with tasks lately.",
  "detected_emotion": { "stress": 55.2, "frustration": 41.7, "neutral": 3.1 },
  "assistant_response": "It sounds like you’re under a lot of pressure. Have you considered sharing your workload concerns with your manager?"
}

```
* NLP Model → Generates empathetic response using input + retrieved memories + emotion state
* Output → `"I am sorry to hear that you had a difficult day. I remember you mentioned before that your manager was assigning too many tasks. Would you like to talk more about that, or would you prefer something uplifting to take your mind off it?"`

## Vision

EIVA is designed as:

* A **personalized digital companion** capable of adapting to user preferences.
* An **emotionally aware assistant** that responds with empathy and contextual intelligence.
* A **research and development platform** for advancing emotion-aware, memory-driven AI systems.
